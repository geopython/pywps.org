## GitHub (Wiki, Issues, Code)

The PyWPS [wiki](https://github.com/geopython/pywps/wiki) provides an area for
supporting information that frequently changes and / or is outside the scope of
the formal documentation.

PyWPS' [issue tracker](https://github.com/geopython/pywps/issues) is the place
to report bugs or request enhancements. To submit a bug be sure to specify the
version you are using, the appropriate component, a description of how to
reproduce the bug, as well as what version of Python and platform.

GitHub provides the ability for users to issue pull requests, and is the
preferred way to have your contributions added to PyWPS, although patches and
other mechanisms are welcome as well.

All PyWPS [source code](https://github.com/geopython/pywps) is managed on
GitHub, which includes the latest (master) and other supported branches.
