# Welcome to PyWPS

PyWPS (Python Web Processing Service) is an implementation of the [Web
processing Service standard](http://opengeospatial.org/standards/wps) from
[Open Geospatial Consortium](http://opengeospatial.org). PyWPS is written in
[Python](http://python.org).

The project was initially started by [Jachym Cepicky](http://les-ejk.cz) as
part of his project 'Connecting of GRASS GIS with UMN MapServer' supported by
the [German Foundation for Environment](http://dbu.de/).  He began to work on
this project from April 2006 to September 2006, while on scholarship by
[GDF-Hannover](http://gdf-hannover.de/).

PyWPS enables integration, publishing and execution of Python processes via the WPS standard.

PyWPS is Open Source and released under an MIT [license](license).
