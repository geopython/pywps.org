# Welcome to PyWPS

PyWPS (Python Web Processing Service) is an implementation of the [Web
processing Service standard](http://opengeospatial.org/standards/wps)  issued by the
[Open Geospatial Consortium](http://opengeospatial.org), written in
the [Python](http://python.org) language.

PyWPS was started by [Jachym Cepicky](http://les-ejk.cz) as
part of his project 'Connecting of GRASS GIS with UMN MapServer', supported by
the [German Foundation for Environment](http://dbu.de/).  He began to work on this project with a scholarship by [GDF-Hannover](http://gdf-hannover.de) that went from April to September of 2006.

PyWPS enables integration, publishing and execution of Python processes via the WPS standard.

PyWPS is Open Source and released under an MIT [license](license).
