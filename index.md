# Welcome to PyWPS

PyWPS is an implementation of the [Web Processing Service](https://opengeospatial.org/standards/wps)
standard from the [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://opengeospatial.org). PyWPS is written in [Python](https://python.org).

PyWPS was started by [Jachym Cepicky](http://les-ejk.cz) as
part of his project 'Connecting of GRASS GIS with UMN MapServer', supported by
the [German Foundation for Environment](http://dbu.de/).  He began to work on this project with a scholarship by [GDF-Hannover](http://gdf-hannover.de) that went from April to September of 2006.

PyWPS enables integration, publishing and execution of Python processes via the WPS standard.

PyWPS is Open Source and released under an MIT [license](license).
