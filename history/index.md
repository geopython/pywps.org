# History

PyWPS was initially started by [Jachym Cepicky](http://les-ejk.cz) as part of his project 'Connecting of GRASS GIS with UMN MapServer' supported by the [German Foundation for Environment](http://dbu.de).  He began to work on this project with a scholarship by [GDF-Hannover](http://gdf-hannover.de) that went from April to September of 2006.

The first PyWPS site as a demo application was the [WPS Demo](http://www.bnhelp.cz/mapserv/wpsdemo/index.php) provided by [Help Service Remote Sensing](http://www.bnhelp.cz>).

The first presentation about PyWPS was held at the [FOSS4G 2006](http://foss4g2006.org) conference in Lausanne titled '[GRASS goes to web: PyWPS](http://www.foss4g2006.org/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=67&sessionId=48&confId=1)'.

Around October of 2006, the project homepage was moved from Jachym's personal homepage to a GForge server hosted at <http://wald.intevation.org> (maintained by [Intevation GmbH](http://intevation.org)`) to support their projects. Since then, PyWPS has its own mailing lists, source code repository and other necessary infrastructure for Open Source project.

In October of 2006, additional developers joined the development effort.  Please see [PyWPS Development Team](../contributors) for a list of current and past contributors.

## 2006-11-10: version 1.0.0 released

During November 2006, Lorenzo Becchi and Luca Casagrande started their work
on a Web User Interface for WPS. They lunched two projects: 
[WUIW and Embrio](http://pywps.ominiverdi.org). WUIW should be a
general web interace able to handle any WPS server. Embrio is bringing
functionality of [GRASS GIS](http://grass.itc.it) to the
Internet. WUIW and Embrio are part of the PyWPS repository.

## 2007-10-08: version 2.0.0 released

A new version improved stability, approached on the standard implementation
and introduced the Python `Process` class to which methods can be
used in process coding/implementation.  A new WPS client project was launched
as well as a WPS plugin for [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org).

## 2008-11-06: version 3.0.0 released

A new version with improved stability, a new code structure, and a new implementation of
OGC:WPS 1.0.0.

## 2009-06-01: version 3.1.0 released

Improves the `3.x` branch. New generic JavaScript WPS Client library and
more.

## 2013-05

At FOSS4G-CEE, Bucharest we started to talk about a new implementation
of PyWPS, which would use all the benefits of the current Python world. First
lines were written at the codesprint after the conference.

## 2014-04

Thanks to the [Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology](http://www.list.lu), the first PyWPS workshop
was organized in Luxembourg. The discussion on PyWPS-4 started.

## 2015

Thanks to the [Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology](http://www.list.lu), two developers
actively worked on PyWPS-4. Also thanks to the Google Summer of Code, one
student was accepted.  PyWPS-4 also got a new REST interface.

## 2016-02

PyWPS-4 branch was merged to official PyWPS repository as it's `master` branch.
PyWPS moved to http://pywps.org domain, finally!
