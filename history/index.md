# History

PyWPS was initially started by [Jachym Cepicky](http://les-ejk.cz) as part of his project 'Connecting of GRASS GIS with UMN MapServer' supported by the [German Foundation for Environment](http://dbu.de).  He began to work on this project from April 2006 to September 2006, while on scholarship by [GDF-Hannover](http://gdf-hannover.de).

The first PyWPS site as a demo application was the [WPS Demo](http://www.bnhelp.cz/mapserv/wpsdemo/index.php) provided by [Help Service Remote Sensing](http://www.bnhelp.cz>).

The first presentation about PyWPS was held at [FOSS4G 2006](http://foss4g2006.org) conference in Lausanne titled '[GRASS goes to web: PyWPS](http://www.foss4g2006.org/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=67&sessionId=48&confId=1)'.

Around October 2006, the project homepage has been moved from Jachym's personal homepage to GForge server hosted on <http://wald.intevation.org> (maintained by [Intevation GmbH](http://intevation.org)`) to support their projects. Since then, PyWPS has its own mailing lists, source code repository and other necessary infrastructure for Open Source project.

In October 2006, additional developers joined the development effort.  Please see [PyWPS Development Team](../contributors) for a list of current and past contributors.

**2006-11-10: version 1.0.0 released**

During November 2006, Lorenzo Becchi and Luca Casagrande started their work
on Web User Interface for WPS. They lunched two projects: 
[WUIW and Embrio](http://pywps.ominiverdi.org). WUIW should be
general web interace able to handle any WPS server. Embrio is bringing
functionality of [GRASS GIS](http://grass.itc.it) to the
Internet. WUIW and Embrio are part of PyWPS's repository

**2007-10-08: version 2.0.0 released**

New version improved stability, approached in the standard implementation
and introduced the Python `Process` class to which methods can be
used in process coding/implementation.  A new WPS client project was launched
as well as a WPS plugin for [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org)

**2008-11-06: version 3.0.0 released**

New version improved stability, new code structure, and implementation of
OGC:WPS 1.0.0

**2009-06-01: version 3.1.0 released**

Improves `3.x` branch. New generic JavaScript WPS Client library and
more

**2013-05**

At FOSS4G-CEE, Bucharest we started to talk about a new implementation
of PyWPS, which would use all the benefits of the current Python world. First
lines were written at the codesprint after the conference

**2014-04**

Thanks to <http://www.list.lu>, the first PyWPS workshop
was organized in Luxembourg. PyWPS-4 discussion started

**2015**

Thanks to <http://www.list.lu>, two full-time developers
were actively working on PyWPS-4. Also thanks to Google Summer of Code, one
student was accepted.  PyWPS-4 also gets a new REST interface
