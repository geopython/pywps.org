# PyWPS finished the OSGeo incubation process

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSGeo/osgeo/master/incubation/project/OSGeo_project.png)

On April 11th 2018, OSGeo Board of Directors recognized [1] PyWPS project as an
official OSGeo project, thanks to the efforts of the PyWPS Project Steering
committee and Tom Kralidis, our incubation mentor. The incubation process
started 9 years ago [2] and was one of the longest processes within the OSGeo
ecosystem. Over this time, PyWPS demonstrated [3] a stable community, evolving
into version 4 with completely new code base and license change, took part on
several Google Summer of Code events, formed a Project Steering Committee [4]
and many more.
