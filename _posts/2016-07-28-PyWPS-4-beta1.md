# PyWPS 4.0.0-beta1 released

The PyWPS development team has just released the first *beta* version of the
upcoming PyWPS 4.0. This new release is a complete re-write of PyWPS, taking
full advantage of modern Python technologies.

For a bit of history and a quick overview of PyWPS-4 there is 
[this presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/Luis_de_Sousa/pywps-64463325).

For a more in depth information please consult the [article recently published by 
ISPRS](http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLI-B7/927/2016/). 

The source code for this *beta* release is available at 
[GitHub](https://github.com/geopython/pywps/releases/tag/pywps-4.0.0-beta1). 
Please follow [the documentation](http://pywps.readthedocs.io) 
to install PyWPS 4.0 and the accompanying demo application.

This *beta* release aims to fully comply with the WPS 1.0 standard and support 
seamless integration with GRASS GIS. Please report your feedback at the
