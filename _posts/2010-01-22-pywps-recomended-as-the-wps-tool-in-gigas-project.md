# PyWPS Recommended as THE WPS tool in GIGAS project

PyWPS was recommended as WPS tool in the [GIGAS](http://www.thegigasforum.eu) project.

PyWPS Web Processing Service: is a Python program which implements the
OGC WPS 1.0.0 standard (with a few omissions). PyWPS was chosen as it
is up to date with the WPS standard and has a low footprint, making it
easy to install on most Linux systems.  Python was considered a good
choice of implementation language as it is a very easy language to
develop in and allows partners to easily integrate existing processing
which may have been written in other languages. PyWPS documentation may
be found at <http://pywps.wald.intevation.org/documentation/index.html>
