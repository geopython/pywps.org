# Requests for comments

An RFC is a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations
applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. It is
submitted either for peer review or simply to convey new concepts, information,
or (occasionally) engineering humor. The IETF adopts some of the proposals
published as RFCs as Internet standards.

An RFC describes a major change in the technological underpinnings of pycsw,
major additions to functionality, or changes in the direction of the project.
